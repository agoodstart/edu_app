# About this project

This project is built for integrading and enhancing the use of the NOVI edhub system in a flexible way.
This app will increase the educational experience for both students and teachers, making it more accessible than ever before.

This app's primary goal is easy access: it must be clear and intuitive. The user should not get lost. The user's destination shouldn't be more than 3 clicks away.

# Using the readme

This readme will act as a log. I will probably dump some ideas in here and links, as well as possible roadmaps.

## Starting up ##
_20 - 10 - 2020_

Before I start coding, I need to know what I want to do with this project... I need to know if I am able to access certain resources,
like integrading MS Teams, am I allowed to access some of the NOVI edhub data?

That is a worry for later. First let's brainstorm about the UI. But where do I start?
